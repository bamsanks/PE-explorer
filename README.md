# PE Explorer
PE Explorer is an in-browser EXE/DLL reader. It extracts details from a Portable Executable (PE) file, including imports / exports and resources.
Everything is done locally - nothing gets sent to a server, and it can be used offline.

You can use it <a href="https://bamsanks.github.io/PE-explorer/explorer.htm">here</a>.
